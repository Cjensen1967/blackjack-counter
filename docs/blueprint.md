# **App Name**: CountSight Trainer

## Core Features:

- Card Layout Generation: Display a random static layout of 12 playing cards from a single deck, arranged to mimic a dealer's completed round.
- User Count Input: Input field for users to enter their Hi-Lo count assessment of the displayed hand. Enforce numeric input and basic validation.
- Immediate Feedback System: Provide immediate feedback on the user's input with a visual cue (✅ for correct, ❌ and correct count for incorrect).
- Drill Refresh: Implement a 'New Drill' button that reshuffles the deck and generates a new 12-card layout upon activation.
- Progressive Timing System: Automatically decrease the card display time after each correct answer to gradually increase difficulty and encourage skill improvement.
- Theme Switching: Provide both light and dark themes with persistent user preference.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#34495E) to convey focus and seriousness, appropriate for a training environment.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F2F3F4), nearly white, for minimal distraction.
- Accent color: A vibrant green (#2ECC71) to indicate correct answers and positive feedback, analogous to blue with a brighter presence.
- Dark Mode Colors: Provide a dark theme alternative with appropriate contrast ratios. Primary color shifts to a lighter blue (#4A6FA5) in dark mode, and background shifts to a dark gray (#121212) to reduce eye strain in low-light environments.
- Use a clear, sans-serif font optimized for readability. Focus on clean presentation to reduce cognitive load.
- Employ simple, geometric icons for feedback (e.g., checkmark, cross) that are easily recognizable.
- Organize cards in a clear, grid-like fashion. Use a spacious and uncluttered layout to facilitate quick visual processing.
- Introduce subtle animations (e.g., a gentle fade) when transitioning between card layouts or displaying feedback. Animations should be brief and non-distracting.
